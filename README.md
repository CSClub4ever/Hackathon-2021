# Hackathon-2021
These files belong to an anonymous participant. Their work will be counted as part of next year's Hackathon work since not many people showed up this time.
This game is meant for Wartburg Students only because the W stands for Wartburg College. The blue heads represent Luther College. The goal of the game is not to be killed by the blue horns (you get killed if you jump on it) and get to the door.  The blue heads will move right to left and left to right randomly.
