This game is meant for Wartburg Students only because the W stands for Wartburg College. The blue heads represent Luther College. The goal of the game is not to be killed by the blue horns (you get killed if you jump on it) and get to the door.  The blue heads will move right to left and left to right randomly.

Hello!
Contained within these files is my own work on a game which I call Sir Victor's Quest!
There is still quite a bit to do with it, but here is my work thus far.
To Do:
Ability to change velocity and angle of projectile
Collision with the key (to win)
Blocks to block in the key
Collision of projectile with blocks (should blow up)
Gravity applied to key and blocks
Limit number of projectiles you get on each level
More level layouts
Startup Screen
You Won! Screen
I hope that you enjoy this game as much as I enjoyed making it!
Thanks,
